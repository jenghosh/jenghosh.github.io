											<h1>Hi, I’m Jenny!<br />
											</h1>
											<p>Professional Writer</p>
										</header>
										<p>I am interested in exploring different forms of writing and digital composition present throughout society. As a writer, I value language and speech, especially free speech, and I am passionate about advocating for anti-censorship within the media. I am also interested in the use of artificial intelligence in writing, and how it is bringing changes to multiple industries.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>I am currently completing a Professional Writing Honours degree at York University, specializing in Digital Authoring and Book Publishing. During my journey in the program, I’ve completed several research assignments which have contributed to my knowledge regarding digital composing.</p> 
                                        
                                        <p>My first assignment was an observation of cancel culture, with a specific focus on South Korea, including 3 case studies, as well as possible solutions to mitigate the detrimental nature of this online phenomenon. My second assignment looked at a piece of contentious writing and public responses to it. I wrote about Jian Ghomeshi’s 2018 essay for the New York Review of Books, which later caused editor Ian Buruma to resign due to public backlash. My third assignment was an article regarding an interview with Robert W. Fiesler regarding his award-winning debut book, Tinderbox. More recently, I studied the impact of fanfiction production and consumption, particularly in regards to how it contributes to parasocial relationships. Another recent assignment included an observation of South Asian cultural appropriation within K-pop music. My last assignment was examining different rhetorical persuasion techniques used by TikTok content creators.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Outside of academia, I enjoy reading, creative writing, and watching shows and movies.</p>
